    <section style="text-align: justify;">
        <dfn>Sloths</dfn> are tropical mammals that live in <b>Central and South America.</b>
        They use their long claws to hang onto branches while they feast on the leaves that other animals can't reach.
        The sloth's long claws — 8 to 10 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> — <i> make walking on the ground
            difficult,</i>so they spend most of their time in the tall trees they call home.

    <h2>Biology</h2>
    <p>
        There are <em>six species</em> of sloth, and they come in two varieties: two-toed and three-toed.
        Three-toed sloths are about the size of a medium-sized dog at around 23 to 27 inches (58 to 68 cm) and 17.5 to
        18.75 lbs.
        (about 8 kilograms). The two-toed sloths are slightly bigger than the three-toed sloths, though they share many
        of the same features.

        Thousands of years ago, sloths were much larger. Ancient sloths could grow to be as large as an elephant.
        They roamed North America and became extinct around 10,000 years ago.
        Sloths have an average life span of 20 to 30 years in the wild, but captive sloths tend to live a bit longer.
        <del>In 2017, a captive sloth at the Adelaide Zoo in Australia died at age 43.</del>
